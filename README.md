# Rise-In-Weekly-Projects
Rise In Polkadot Substrate Development Bootcamp has weekly projects. This repo is a place to store these projects, as a public GitHub URL of workign code is required for (peer) evaluation.
I've set up a week1 subfolder for the first week's submission.

Week 1:  Using Strings and String slices in a function to demonstrate borrowing and ownership.
